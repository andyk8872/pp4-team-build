## Agile Methodology

### Github Project Board

* Although not specially designed for this the project board in github works well enabling me to track my user stories.
* This enabled me to manage the project by breaking it up into several phases.
*  Once the project had started it allowed me to cycle through the process to planning, executing and evaluating.
